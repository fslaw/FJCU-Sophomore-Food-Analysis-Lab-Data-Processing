# Experiment 4: Standard Solutions and Titratable Acidity

This directory contains the data analysis files for Experiment 4 of the FJCU Sophomore Food Analysis Lab. The experiment involves the standardization of NaOH and HCl solutions, followed by the potentiometric titration of apple juice to determine its titratable acidity (TA) and estimate its primary pKa.

## Files

* **`standardization_and_titratable_acidity2_en.csv`**:
    * The raw experimental data file.
    * Contains data for Part A (Standardization of NaOH and HCl) and Part B (Potentiometric titration of apple juice sample C).
    * Includes calculated intermediate values (N, Mean, SD) for verification.
* **`titration_curve_en_v2.0.py`**:
    * The main Python script used for data analysis and visualization.
    * Reads data from the `.csv` file.
    * Verifies the standardization calculations (Part A).
    * Analyzes the titration data (Part B) to calculate the endpoint volume (at pH 8.2 via interpolation), titratable acidity (%), and estimates the apparent pKa using the half-equivalence point method.
    * Generates the final titration curve plot with error bars and annotations.
* **`requirements.txt`**:
    * Lists the necessary Python libraries (`pandas`, `matplotlib`, `numpy`) required to run the analysis script.
    * To install dependencies, run: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
* **`titration_curve_plot_with_points_v2.0.png`**:
    * The output plot generated by the Python script (`titration_curve_en_v2.0.py`).
    * Visualizes the titration curve, endpoint, estimated pKa, calculated TA, and includes fixed absolute error bars based on error propagation analysis.

## Analysis Summary

The Python script (`titration_curve_en_v2.0.py`) performs the following key calculations:

1.  **Verification**: Compares script-calculated Normality (N), mean, and standard deviation against the values present in the CSV for both NaOH and HCl standardization.
2.  **Endpoint Determination**: Uses `numpy.interp` for linear interpolation to find the precise volume of NaOH required to reach the pH 8.2 endpoint.
3.  **Titratable Acidity (TA)**: Calculates TA (%) based on the interpolated endpoint volume, standardized NaOH normality (0.09910 N), assumed citric acid equivalent weight (64.04), and sample volume (20.0 mL), using the standard formula.
4.  **pKa Estimation**: Determines the half-equivalence point volume and uses `numpy.interp` again to estimate the apparent pKa at that volume.
5.  **Error Representation**: Adds fixed absolute error bars (Â±0.068 mL) to the titration curve plot, reflecting the propagated error for sequential readings from a single burette fill.

## Usage

1.  Ensure you have Python 3 installed.
2.  Install the required libraries: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3.  Run the analysis script: `python titration_curve_en_v2.0.py`
4.  The script will print verification and analysis results to the console and generate/overwrite the `titration_curve_plot_with_points_v2.0.png` file.
